# Every python file is a module...

# import dog
# dog.bark()

# from dog import bark
# bark()




# if modules are in a folder then we will have to create a "__init__.py" file in that folder to tell that the folder has modules in it

# from lib import dog
# dog.bark()

# from lib.dog import bark
# bark()



#  Apart from the modules we make, we can use alot more pre-build modules from the Python Standard Library...

# math for math utilities
# re for regular expressions
# json to work with JSON
# datetime to work with dates
# sqlite3 to user SQLite
# cs for Opresting System Utilities
# random for random number generation
# statistics for statistics utilities
# requests to perform HTTP network requests
# http to create HTTP servers
# urllib to manage URLS

import math

print(math.sqrt(4))
